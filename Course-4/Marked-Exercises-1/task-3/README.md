## Task 3

**Write a program that implements the C-LOOK disk scheduling algorithm. This program should:**

- Prompt the user to enter   10  disk locations to service   (0âˆ’199) 
- The disk head should start on sector   10  and move toward sector   199 
- The head responds to each request in the direction it is going, until all requests are handled.
- Calculate the absolute distance of the tracks from the head.
- This distance adds to the total seek count.
- If we reach the final request in the current direction, reverse direction and move the head all the way to the location of the last request in this direction.
- Move the head in the initial direction, servicing requests until all have been completed.
