# Marked Exercises 2

## Task 1 -  Given the following information:

- A virtual memory has a page size of 1k (1024) words.
- There are 8 pages.
- There are 4 blocks.

**The memory page table contains the information below:**

|Page |	Block |
| 0	  | 3     |
| 1	  | 1     |
| 4	  | 2     |
| 6	  | 0     |

Select all of the following address ranges that will result in a page fault.

Hint: Page faults occur on page numbers not specified in the memory page table. Calculate the address range by using the page of 1024 words.

## Solution

Pages 8 pages: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Memory ranges:

0 -> 0 - 1023

1 -> 1024 - 2047

2 -> 2048 - 3071

3 -> 3072 - 4095

4 -> 4096 - 5119

5 -> 5120 - 6143

6 -> 6144 - 7167

7 -> 7168 - 8191

Specified: 0, 1, 4, 6 -> error will occur on unspecified pages:

2 -> 2048 - 3071

3 -> 3072 - 4095
