# Marked Exercise 1

## Task 2

Write a C program that:

- Requests the length, N, of an array as user input.
- Prompts the user to enter each integer array value
- Uses the malloc() function to dynamically allocate memory to hold   N  integer numbers entered by the user
- Checks if memory has been properly allocated
- Prints the sum of all of the array values.
- Frees up used memory when finished

Your output should look like the output below when run.

	Enter value of N [1-10]: 3
	Enter 3 integer number(s)
	Enter #1: 1
	Enter #2: 2
	Enter #3: 3
	Sum: 6
