# Marked Exercises 2

## Task 2 - Project: UNIX Shell

You will create a command line interpreter (CLI) or, as it is more often known, a shell in this assignment. When you type a command into the shell (in response to its prompt), the shell creates a child process that executes the command you gave and then prompts for more user input once it’s finished.

Your shells will be similar to, but simpler than, the ones you use on a daily basis in Unix. If you’re not sure what shell you’re using, it’s most likely bash.

One thing you should do on your own time is read the man pages or other internet materials to understand more about your shell.
